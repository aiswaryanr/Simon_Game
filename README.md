# Simon_Game

### Overview
The Simon game is a classic memory and pattern recognition game that challenges players to repeat a sequence of colors and sounds generated by the computer. The game is implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with jQuery.

### Features
1. **Dynamic Sequences:**
   - The computer generates a random sequence of colors that the player must replicate.

2. **User Interaction:**
   - Players interact with the game by clicking on colored buttons representing different tones.

3. **Level Progression:**
   - The game progresses through levels, with each level increasing in difficulty by adding a new color to the sequence.

4. **Visual and Auditory Feedback:**
   - Visual feedback is provided through button animations when clicked, and auditory feedback is given by playing corresponding sounds for each color.

5. **Game Over and Restart:**
   - If the player makes a mistake, the game displays a "Game Over" message, adds a visual effect to the background, and allows the player to restart by pressing any key.

### Implementation Details
1. **HTML:**
   - The HTML structure includes buttons for each color, a level title, and a basic container for the game.

2. **CSS:**
   - CSS styles are applied to create a visually appealing interface. Animations are used to provide feedback on button clicks and game over events.

3. **JavaScript and jQuery:**
   - JavaScript is used to handle user input, generate random sequences, and manage game logic.
   - jQuery is utilized for DOM manipulation and event handling.

4. **Functions:**
   - **checkAnswer(currentLevel):** Compares the user's input with the computer-generated sequence, progressing the game if correct or triggering a game over if incorrect.
   - **nextSequence():** Generates the next color in the sequence, updates the level, and provides visual and auditory feedback.
   - **playSound(name):** Plays the sound associated with a given color.
   - **animatePress(currentColour):** Animates the button press effect.
   - **startOver():** Resets the game variables to restart the game.
